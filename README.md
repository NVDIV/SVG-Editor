# SVG-Editor

## Overview

This project is a Java-based SVG Shape Renderer that outputs an SVG scene file representing multiple shapes with customizable colors and line styles. It was created during my second semester to practice object-oriented programming, Java collections, and file handling.

## Features

- Polygon Creation: Define polygons with customizable points and styles.
- Ellipse and Circle Support: Create ellipses and circles with different radius lengths and colors.
- Line Segments: Draw line segments to connect specific points.
- Customizable Styles: Set fill color, stroke color, and stroke width for each shape.
- SVG Output: Save the generated scene as an SVG file, viewable in any web browser.

## Project Structure

- Main Class: Initializes shapes, styles, and scene generation.
- Classes for Shapes and Styles: Polygon, Ellipse, Segment, and Style classes are used for shape and styling properties.
- SVG Scene Generation: The SvgScene class compiles the shapes and exports an SVG file.
  
## Usage

1. Run the Main class.
2. An scene.html file will be generated in the project directory.
3. Open scene.html in any web browser to view the rendered SVG shapes.

## Technologies Used
